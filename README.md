# JavaScript DApp Template

This is a template for JavaScript Cartesi DApps. It uses node to execute the backend application.
The application entrypoint is the `src/index.js` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.

## Project Idea: dStore - A Decentralized Marketplace

dStore is a decentralized application that allows users to buy and sell products using Cartesi Rollups. It will have the following features:

## User Registration: Register new users

Product Listings: Users can list products for sale.
Cartesi Integration: Integrate Cartesi Rollups for handling off-chain operations like vouchers and notices.
Purchases: Users can purchase products listed by other users.
Reports: Generate purchase reports using Cartesi Rollups.
